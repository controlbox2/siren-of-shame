# What Is It? #

Siren of shame is a [build monitor](http://sirenofshame.com/buildmonitor) that connects to:
  * TFS (2008, 2010)
  * Jenkins (1.4)
  * Hudson (1.3, 2.0)
  * Team City (5.0, 6.0, 7.0)
  * Bamboo (2.3, 3.0)
  * CruiseControl.Net (1.8)
  * Travis
  * Buildbot

It's also a reputation and achievement system that optionally synchronizes to an online [leader board](http://www.sirenofshame.com/Leaders).

It is also an API for an optional USB siren that is available for purchase at http://sirenofshame.com.
